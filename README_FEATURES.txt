TheorySmith Pro — Detailed Feature Overview

This document provides an in-depth look at the core features of
TheorySmith Pro.

1. AI Theory Generation

Powered by Ollama and LLaMA-based models, the system transforms
natural-language physics ideas into structured theoretical frameworks.

Capabilities:

-   Identify physical entities, variables, forces, and constraints.
-   Build mathematical expressions from conceptual descriptions.
-   Translate imaginative ideas into realistic scientific models.

2. Mathematical Model Builder

-   Generates symbolic formulas for systems.
-   Converts equations into solvable numerical models.
-   Detects inconsistencies and suggests alternative structures.

3. Visualization Engine (Matplotlib)

-   Line plots, scatter plots, vector fields.
-   Time-based simulation graphs.
-   Energy curves, particle trajectories, field deformations.

4. Simulation Layer

Uses NumPy/SciPy numerical solvers to: - Run dynamic simulations. -
Iterate across time intervals. - Compare different scenarios. - Compute
system stability and trajectory divergence.

5. Plausibility & Physical Validity System

Checks for: - Conservation laws - Dimensional consistency - Logical
contradictions - Mathematical feasibility

6. Creative Mode

-   Fictional physics generation
-   New rule systems for sci‑fi worlds
-   Internal consistency analysis
